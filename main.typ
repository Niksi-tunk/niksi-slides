  = What's the problem?

  Early stages of programming education often suffer from time
  being wasted installing the course specific development environment on
  the students machine. *That time could be used on learning programming*.

  Each student has their own machine with problems specific to that machine
  so no single documentation can help everyone.
  This is a tremendous waste of time and resources and often leaves the
  student feeling discouraged about programming.

#slide[
  = How does Niksi solve it

  Niksi utilizes the promises given by the Nix package manager.
  It allows the teacher of a course to define the development environment
  needed for that specific course.

  For the end-user (the students), Niksi ?? as a simple and intuitive interface
  that allows the student to start coding immediately without having to
  pay any attention to the boring stuff
  #footnote[Altough it might be useful to learn the boring stuff at some point].
